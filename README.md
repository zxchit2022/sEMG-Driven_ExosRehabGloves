# sEMG-Driven_ExosRehabGloves
 This is an sEMG-driven exoskeleton rehabilitation glove designed for stroke patients with hemiplegia. We utilize sEMG signal acquisition device to capture and recognize hand movements from the patientâ€™s healthy limb. The exoskeleton glove then aids the impaired limb in performing rehabilitation exercises. A demonstration video is attached.
